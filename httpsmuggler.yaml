  name: HTTP Request Smuggling (CL.TE)
  author: projectdiscovery
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template attempts to detect CL.TE (Content-Length + Transfer-Encoding) based HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities.
    Vulnerable systems may process the request differently between front-end and back-end servers, allowing request smuggling.
